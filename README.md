# requires: JQuery.

This script requires specific HTML that you can find in the example in the main page.

The script adds event for opening and closing containers.
You can put as many containers as you want on the page the script will handle them all automatically.
You jsut need to include the script.

The current HTML uses dash-icons that are included, this is only for the arrows you can change that.
The speed of the collapsing containers can be controlled by the member variable ticInterval in the vertical-collapse script.
